# optimal_network_path
## Finding the optimal path  between nodes in given network modeled as  graph.

Before you run the optimal_path.py make sure you have atleast Python 3.8.10

Run the optimal_path.py file by following command in terminal:
```
python3 optimal_path.py
```

[Heuristic Function Document](/assets/documents/heuristic_documentation.pdf) contains the proof for the consistency of a heuristic function
